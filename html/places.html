		<h1>Central Market</h1>
		<a href="#"><img id="smart_thumbnail3" class="article-pic" src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2987472.1488498285!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/travel5f-6-web.jpg" alt="Picture of central markets"></a>
		<p>Designated as a market town in 1730, the City of Lancaster is home to Lancaster Central Market, the oldest, continuously running public farmers’ market in the country. More than 60 local vendors call the beautiful 1889 Market House home three days each week, when it opens its doors to welcome the surrounding community. A step inside is sure to highlight all that Lancaster County has to offer. A walk through its aisles will find an abundance of produce from the deeply nutrient-rich soils native to the local landscape; an array of prepared foods representing the proud cultural diversity of the county; and locally sourced meat, poultry, cheeses, and more.</p>

    <h1>Strasburg Railroad</h1>
		<a href="#"><img id="smart_thumbnail4" class="article-pic" src="http://www.discoverlancaster.com/uploads/members/strasburg_rail_road/strasburg-railroadm2014.jpg" alt="Picture of central markets"></a>
		<p>Strasburg Rail Road™ is America’s oldest operating railroad with a charter dating back to June 9, 1832. First used for passenger and freight transportation, the short line limped along for more than a century until in 1958, on the verge of abandonment, the railroad was salvaged and given new life as a tourist railroad. When you visit Strasburg Rail Road, the first thing you can expect is an authentic experience of a real steam railroad. The locomotives and passenger cars, (known as “rolling stock”) are not replicas, and our staff members are not reenactors. Strasburg Rail Road has five working steam locomotives and 19 operating passenger cars, including their President’s Car, First-Class Parlor Car and their Dining Car. All equipment is restored and maintained on-site in their Mechanical Shop.</p>

    <h1>Dutch Wonderland</h1>
